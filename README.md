# üìä Classification Model for Salary Prediction

This project focuses on building a classification model to predict salary levels based on various features. The dataset used in this project contains information about individuals, including their age, work class, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, native country, and income.

## üìã Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from a CSV file named 'adult.csv'. It is loaded into a pandas dataframe and thoroughly explored to understand its structure and characteristics. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values and converting categorical variables into numerical representations using label encoding.

## üõ†Ô∏è Model Building
Four different classification models are implemented in this project:

1. **Decision Tree**: A decision tree classifier is trained using the training data and then used to predict salary levels on the test data.
2. **Logistic Regression**: Logistic regression is employed as a classification algorithm to predict salary levels based on the provided features.
3. **Random Forest Classifier**: A random forest classifier is trained to predict salary levels by constructing an ensemble of decision trees.
4. **KNN Classifier**: A K-nearest neighbors classifier is used to classify salary levels based on the nearest neighbors in the feature space.

## üìä Model Evaluation
The accuracy of each model is assessed using various evaluation metrics, including confusion matrices and classification reports. These metrics provide insights into the model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The misclassification percentage is also calculated to quantify the percentage of misclassified instances.

## üöÄ Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn.
2. Download the 'adult.csv' dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
3. Run the provided code to load the dataset, preprocess it, and build the classification models.
4. Evaluate the performance of each model using the generated metrics and analyze the results.
5. Make necessary adjustments to improve the model's performance, such as tuning hyperparameters or trying different algorithms.
6. By utilizing this classification model for salary prediction, users can gain insights into the factors influencing salary levels and make informed decisions based on the model's predictions.
